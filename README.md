# Research-Project-Website
A website created for a professors research project on how race and gender affect ones choice of a doctor on 1000+ participants.

The participants are linked to this page in the middle of a survey on prolific.co.
They are first met with a login page.
Here they enter the unique id given to them by the survey site. This allows us to connect the survey data with their answer on the website.

After submitting their ID the participant is brought to a page with 6 doctors of different races and genders.
These doctors have random ratings in the same range and a random distance from "home"
The order of these doctors is randomized for each user so the dactor at the top has no advantage.
The images were picked out of hundreds and were surveyed to be most alike in catagories such as age, attractiveness, and percieved intelligence.
